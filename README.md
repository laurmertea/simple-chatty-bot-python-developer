## A simple console chat bot (as seen on the JetBrains Academy / Hyperskill Python developer plan)

### About
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot 
will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey 
you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. 
Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

### Stage 1: Hello! What's your name
Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.

### Stage 2: What's my name?
Introduce yourself to the bot.

### Stage 3: How old are you?
Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.

### Stage 4: Let's count
Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. 
And you are experienced enough to apply a for loop at this stage!

### Stage 5: The student and the teacher
At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. 
Add some functions to your code and make the stage even better.
